Base repository to demonstrate the process of uploading an [`aar`](https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/tools/tech-docs/new-build-system/aar-format)/[`jar`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)) to [JCenter/Bintray](https://bintray.com/).

**Blog Post :** [Guide to publishing your Android Library via Jcenter/Bintray](http://crushingcode.co/publish-your-android-library-via-jcenter/) 

The process is as follows

1. Create an Android project or open an existing one in [Android Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Studio)

1. Init the project with git and also create a repo on Github for the same. Each step here onwards represent a commit and should be pushed to github.

1. Create and add a new module and choose `Android Library`.
   > Goto `File>New>New Module..` and select `Android Library`.
   
   ![newmodule](https://github.com/nisrulz/UploadToBintray/raw/master/img/newmodule.jpeg)
   
   ![newlib](https://github.com/nisrulz/UploadToBintray/raw/master/img/newlib.jpeg)
   
   ![newlibinfo](https://github.com/nisrulz/UploadToBintray/raw/master/img/newlibinfo.jpeg)

1. Implement your library code inside the library module you created in the last step.

1. Next add the library module as a dependency to the app module.
   > 1. Goto `File>Project Structure..`
   > 1. Select `app` module in the sidebar
   > 1. Select the `Dependencies` tab
   > 1. At the bottom is a `+` icon, click that and select `Module dependency` and select your `library` module.
   > 1. Press `apply` or `ok`.

   ![addmodule](https://github.com/nisrulz/UploadToBintray/raw/master/img/addmodule.jpeg)
   
1. Once project is synced, add the required plugins to classpath in build.gradle file at root project level, as shown below
    ```gradle
    dependencies {
      classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.1'
    
      ..
    
      // Required plugins added to classpath to facilitate pushing to Jcenter/Bintray
      classpath 'com.jfrog.bintray.gradle:gradle-bintray-plugin:1.8.4'
      classpath 'com.github.dcendents:android-maven-gradle-plugin:2.1'
      ..
    ```
   
1. Next, apply the `bintray` and `install` plugins at the bottom of build.gradle file at library module level. Also add the ext variable with required information as shown below
    ```gradle
    apply plugin: 'com.android.library'
    
    ext {
     bintrayRepo = 'maven'
     bintrayName = 'awesomelib'   // Has to be same as your library module name
    
     publishedGroupId = 'com.github.nisrulz'
     libraryName = 'AwesomeLib'
     artifact = 'awesomelib'     // Has to be same as your library module name
    
     libraryDescription = 'Android Library to make any text into Toast with Awesome prepended to the text'
    
     // Your github repo link
     siteUrl = 'https://github.com/nisrulz/UploadToBintray'
     gitUrl = 'https://github.com/nisrulz/UploadToBintray.git'
     githubRepository= 'nisrulz/UploadToBintray'
    
     libraryVersion = '1.1'
    
     developerId = 'nisrulz'
     developerName = 'Nishant Srivastava'
     developerEmail = 'nisrulz@gmail.com'
    
     licenseName = 'The Apache Software License, Version 2.0'
     licenseUrl = 'http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt'
     allLicenses = ["Apache-2.0"]
    }
    
    ..
    ..
    
    // Place it at the end of the file
    apply from: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisrulz/JCenter/master/installv1.gradle'
    apply from: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisrulz/JCenter/master/bintrayv1.gradle'
    
    ```  

1. Edit your `local.properties`
    ```
    bintray.user=<your_bintray_username>
    bintray.apikey=<your_bintray_apikey>
    ```
  
1. Now lets setup Bintray before we can push our artifact to it.
    + Register for an account on [bintray.com](https://bintray.com/) and click the activation email they send you.
    + Add a new Maven repository and click **Create New Package**
    + You should now have a maven repository. For instance:
        `https://bintray.com/nisrulz/maven`
    + Now once you have your maven repo setup , click on **Edit**
    
        ![edit](https://github.com/nisrulz/UploadToBintray/raw/master/img/edit.jpeg)
    
        and see that you have selected the option `GPG sign uploaded files using Bintray's public/private key pair.` and then click **Update**.
        
        ![gpg](https://github.com/nisrulz/UploadToBintray/raw/master/img/gpg.jpeg)
    
  
1. Once everything is configured, run the below in your terminal in your root of the project
    ```gradle
    ./gradlew clean build install bintrayUpload
    ```

1. Now once your project is up on bintray, simply hit **Add to Jcenter** button to sync with JCenter.

    ![addtojcenter](https://github.com/nisrulz/UploadToBintray/raw/master/img/addtojcenter.jpeg)

1. Your code is available 
    + through the private repo at bintray
        ```gradle
        repositories { 
          google()
          jcenter()
          maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/<bintray_username>/maven' }
        }
        dependencies {
          compile 'com.github.<bintray_username>:<library_module>:1.1'
        }
        ```
    
        i.e for the sample lib in this repo , `awesomelib`
        ```gradle
        repositories { 
          google()
          jcenter()
          maven { url 'https://dl.bintray.com/nisrulz/maven' }
        }
        dependencies {
          compile 'com.github.nisrulz:awesomelib:1.1'
        }
        ```
    
    + through JCenter if you have received the mail with confirmation
    
        ![finalmail](https://github.com/nisrulz/UploadToBintray/raw/master/img/finalmail.jpeg)
    
1. Few things to note when you received the final email.
      
  + Goto your maven repo at bintray and verify that you have Jcenter under the **Linked to** section

    ![linked](https://github.com/nisrulz/UploadToBintray/raw/master/img/linked.jpeg)

  + Now you would also want to sync the artifact to [MavenCentral](https://search.maven.org/), for that you need to hit the **Maven Central** tab and sync

    ![synctomaven](https://github.com/nisrulz/UploadToBintray/raw/master/img/synctomaven.jpeg)

  + Once you hit sync you would see as below. Wait for few hours for the sync to occur.

    ![syncstatus](https://github.com/nisrulz/UploadToBintray/raw/master/img/syncstatus.jpeg)
    
1. You can use the lib now as follows
    
    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        compile 'com.github.<bintray_username>:<library_module>:1.1'
      }
    ```
    i.e for the sample lib in this repo , `awesomelib`
    ```gradle
    dependencies {
          compile 'com.github.nisrulz:awesomelib:1.1'
      }
    ```

1. Let the world know of your **AwesomeLib** :smile:
    + Add a readme that explains how to integrate and use your Awesome library
    + Add a license block as in this repo
    + Also include the Bintray badge provided by Bintray in your readme
   
      ![badge](https://github.com/nisrulz/UploadToBintray/raw/master/img/badge.jpeg)
    + Promote your lib on social media so that others can know about it.
    + Always add a working sample app in your project that demonstrates your library in use.
    + Add screenshots if possible in your readme
